# COA TASKFORCE TAKE HOME CHALLENGE

## Introduction
Welcome to my COA Taskforce Take-Home Challenge project! This challenge showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my problem-solving abilities. I built an interactive photo gallery based on [Figma UI](https://www.figma.com/design/XF6xlvvHBv12WFveDjVoso/COA-Take-home-Challenge?node-id=1-482&t=jJhFPjhvTgp7K2NC-0) designs and completed two coding challenges that test logical thinking and coding aptitude.

## Coding Challenges

### Coding Challenge 1: Array Manipulation
**Problem Statement:**
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return `true` if such a subarray exists, otherwise return `false`.

**Example:**
```javascript
const arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5];
const target = 17;
console.log(containsSubarrayWithSum(arr, target));
```

**Solution:**
The solution is implemented in `Code-Challenges/arrayMap.js`.

### Coding Challenge 2: String Transformation
**Problem Statement:**
Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:
- If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
- If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, perform both operations in the specified order.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log(applyStringTransformations("Hamburger"));
console.log(applyStringTransformations("Pizza"));
console.log(applyStringTransformations("Chocolate Chip Cookie"));
```

**Solution:**
The solution is implemented in `Code-Challenges/stringTransform.js`.
